# dash-table-experiments

What does a Dash Table component look like? `dash-table-experiments` is a package of alpha-level explorations in a Dash `Table` component. Everything is subject to change. See the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table-experiments/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes.

The Dash Table component will likely be merged into the [`dash-core-components`](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-componets) once it stabilizes.
